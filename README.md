Machine Learning based Power Side-Channel Analysis using STLINK V3 Power Profiler

Using STLINK V3, Power traced 3 different types(AES, ChaCha, and AES-GCM) of encryptions signals from Arduino. Then Collected data and analyzed it with Machine Learning.
tested 4 types of Machine Learning techniques: Random Forest Classifier with Basic Feature Extraction, Gradient Boosting Classifier with Statistical Feature Extraction, Convolutional Neural Network for Time-Series Classification, Enhanced CNN with increased Complexity and Regularization. 

With the Machine Learning method, the highest accuracy is 76% with using Gradient Boosting Classifier with Statistical Feature Extraction techniques.
